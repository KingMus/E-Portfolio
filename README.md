Tutorial to install Metrics 1.3.6 (in form of a mail for the class) :

    Hey guys,
    tomorrow I will hold my e-Portfolio about the eclipse plugin “Metrics 1.3.6”.

    It’s necessary to install it to your Eclipse IDE if you want to use it.

    It’s only available for Eclipse, so if you are in love with IntelliJ and don’t want to betray your ideals, skip the following installation guide.

    Open Eclipse, than open the Help -> Install New Software… - Dialog
    Click on Add… , then choose a name and copy the following URL into the Location field:

    http://metrics.sourceforge.net/update

    After a short moment, a list of items will appear. We want to install everything, so enable them all.
    Click on Next… until you reach the Software Licensing Agreement. You know what to do…
    Finish the process by clicking on the Finish-Button (normally there will open a dialog with a warning during installation… it’s about software from unknown sources. Just ignore it, we know what we’re doing)

    End of Installation Guide, IntelliJ Users can read in safety again.
